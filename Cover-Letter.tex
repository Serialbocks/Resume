Dear Scott,
\\
%references such as what and how you got this information
\vspace{1em}
I'm excited to be applying for the Software Engineer position at \companyName. I have a passion for building and maintaining software that is user-friendly and intuitive.
I'm a programmer with a degree in Computer Engineering, background in music and a passion for creating and maintaining software applications across various platforms.
I'm currently looking for a software engineer position building something exciting that I can be passionate about.

%narrate why you want to apply
\vspace{1em}
During my time at Rack Performance, I worked closely with a small team of developers building a web and mobile application to help high school weight room coaches 
manage workouts, track athlete metrics, and help them focus less on logistics and more on coaching. I enjoyed the feeling of making a big difference 
being one of two or three developers during my time there.
Working at \companyName{} sounds like an exciting opportunity to use my skillset as an engineer and musical
talent. I've played the piano since I was in the 1st grade, about 20 years, and I've performed in a wedding and
have another wedding to play this October. It's been my dream to be able to combine my talents in my career.
