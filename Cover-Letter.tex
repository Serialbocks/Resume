%narrate why you want to apply
\vspace{1em}
During my time at Rack Performance, I worked closely with a small team of developers building a web and mobile application to help high school weight room coaches 
manage workouts, track athlete metrics, and help them focus less on logistics and more on coaching. I enjoyed the feeling of making a big difference 
being one of two or three developers during my time there. Working at \companyName{} sounds like an exciting opportunity to use my skillset to help make 
solar power become a bigger part of the world. I believe it's imperative that we do everything we can to make clean energy affordable, efficient, and
accessible to all.
